# CVE-2018-18925
Exploitation of CVE-2018-18925 a Remote Code Execution against the Git self hosted tool: [Gogs](https://gogs.io/).

Gogs is based on the `Macaron` framework. The system used to manage session is very similar to what PHP does. The session identifier in the cookie is mapped to a file on the file system. When the web server receives a request with a session identifier (as a cookie), it looks up for the file on the file system.

The vulnerability is a simple directory traversal when retrieving the file used for the session on the file system. You can for example, set the i_like_gogits cookie to `../../../../../../etc/passwd` to get an error from the server.
